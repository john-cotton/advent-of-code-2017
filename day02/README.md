# Day 2: Corruption Checksum

https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/2

## Part 1

> The spreadsheet consists of rows of apparently-random _numbers_.
>
>     5 1 9 5
>     7 5 3
>     2 4 6 8
>
> For each row, determine the difference between the largest value and
> the smallest value; the checksum is the sum of all of these
> differences.

## Part 2

> Find the only two numbers in each row where one evenly divides the
> other - that is, where the result of the division operation is a
> whole number - divide them, and add up each line's result.
