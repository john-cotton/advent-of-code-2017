## Part 1

> Given a list of inputs about programs comprising a tower, as:
>
>     name (weight) -> child1, child2, ...
>
> What is the bottom program in the tower?

## Part 2

> For a tower to be balanced, all sub-towers above any program must
> have equal weight.
>
> Given that exactly one program in the input is the wrong weight,
> what would its weight need to be to balance the entire tower?
